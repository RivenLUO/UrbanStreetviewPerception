About Essential Exp1:

    Training comparison models and ranking models on each dataset,
    using softmax loss and binary cross-entropy loss, respectively.

    comparison model (Siamese): VGG19 + Fusion Network (SS-CNN)
    ranking model (Siamese): VGG19 + Ranking Network (RSS-CNN) + Simple Difference

    VGG19 is the only backbone experimented for comparison and ranking models

    Model Architecture:
        VGG19 as the backbone of comparison and ranking models.

        Fusion Network (SS-CNN refer to Dubey et al. (2016)) as comparison module.
        Softmax as output (e.g., [1,0] or [0,1]) with binary cross-entropy loss

        Ranking Network (RSS-CNN refer to Dubey et al. (2016)) as ranking module.
        Simple Difference to calculate the distance between two ranked scores.
        Sigmoid as output to convert the distance to a probability, with binary cross-entropy loss.

    Training with Hyperparameter Optimization:
        Utilizing Bayesian optimization to find the optimal hyperparameters
        for baseline models on each dataset.
