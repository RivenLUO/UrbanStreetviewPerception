- Naming Rules for the model training results:

    ```ModelType_FeatureExtractorBackbone_TransferedWeights_SubnetworkType_DateInfo```
    
  e.g., ```Ranking_VGG19_comparisonweights_FC_20230502_2``` means the model is trained with the Ranking loss, using the VGG19 feature extractor backbone, with the weights transferred from the comparison model, and the subnetwork is FC, and the date is 20230502, and this is the second model trained with the same settings.
